# `poc-flatfile-server`

This POC (Proof Of Concept) demonstrates a client simulating a configurable amount of edge devices, all with their individual connections, and a server, receiving that many connections and storing the data in flat files.

## Current Status
`poc-flatfile-server` is work in progress.

### TODO
* Change the data sent by the simulated edge device to include sensor information.
* Change the data to include information of multiple (10) sensors.
* Change the data to be the protocol to be used.
